            <h2>The Hungry Side of COVID-19: Food Insecurity During the Pandemic</h2>
            <p><i>Vanessa Wong</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>COVID-19 has had a much broader effect than simply being a virus. It has impacted aspects of life that not many people consider, including food insecurity.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Food Insecurity?</strong></p>
            <p>Food insecurity refers to the inability to access food and eat a regular diet that meets dietary needs for a healthy lifestyle due to financial, physical, or social constraints (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 2003). Food insecurity is a serious concern as it has been linked to poor health status and development of chronic conditions including asthma and depression (Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).</p>

            <p><strong>Impacts of COVID-19 on Food Insecurity in Canada</strong></p>
            <p>According to the 2017-2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), it was reported that <strong>12.7%</strong> of households were food insecure (about <strong>4.4 million</strong> individuals) before the pandemic (Tarasuk & Mitchell, 2020). A recent survey done by Statistics Canada in May 2020 reported that the number of Canadian households facing food insecurity has risen to <strong>14.6%</strong>.</p>

            <p>Those who are most vulnerable during this time include households with children, where <strong>19.2%</strong> are food insecure (Statistics Canada, 2020). Moreover, those who have lost their jobs or can not work due to COVID-19 are <strong>three times more likely</strong> to be food insecure (Statistics Canada, 2020). Other vulnerable populations include those who identify as Indigenous or Black (Tarasuk & Mitchell, 2020). In fact, Black households are <strong>3.56 times more likely</strong> to be food insecure than white households (PROOF & FoodShare, 2019) and <strong>50.7%</strong> of First Nations people reported being food insecure in 2017-2018 (Tarasuk & Mitchell, 2020). </p>

            <p><strong>Why Food Insecurity Has Increased</strong></p>
            <p>There is a strong relationship between economic status and food insecurity. With the pandemic causing a strain on the economic industry, it is no wonder that food insecurity has risen. In May 2020, we saw the highest record of unemployment at <strong>13.7%</strong> of Canadians (Statistics Canada, 2020). It has decreased since then (12.3% in June), but still remains very high. Another barrier causing food insecurity surrounds the regulations of physical distancing (Deaton and Deaton, 2020). These policies add additional complications with obtaining food as it limits individuals from accessing services that provide food (i.e. grocery stores, restaurants, food banks) and cause people to stock up on food, leading to food shortages and price increases. These services also face hardship. For example, food banks rely heavily on volunteers who may stop volunteering due to potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>

            <p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
            <p>Food insecurity has been an issue even before the COVID-19 pandemic. It stems from not being able to afford food and having limited access to it, which COVID-19 has put immense pressure on. Households with children and racialized communities including Black and Indigenous people are among those facing food insecurity. These issues will certainly continue to rise, and we will see the true effect of the pandemic when resources such as CERB run out.
