      <p id="ayesha" class="beef boi">Hello! I'm a first-year student in the Bachelor of Health Sciences (Honours) Program at McMaster University. I enjoy learning about the sciences, math, computer science, and history. I'm interested in topics like education, politics, healthcare, the fine arts, and so on.</p>

    <p id="catherine" class="beef boi">Hi! My name is Catherine Fei and I'm a third year Health Sciences student. I joined Tellura as a Head Contributor to help introduce science literature to younger students to open new potentials and interests in STEM. Coming from a smaller neighbourhood, I personally knew nothing about scientific articles until entering university, and the jump between recognition and understanding was a tough transition. I hope Tellura will give students with similar experience as me an opportunity to meet science and stay curious! Fun fact: I buy pretty notebooks but don't write in them because they are too pretty.</p>

Science communication has always been one of my interests, and Tellura is a great initiative that allows me to practice it! Besides that, I'm a pretty laid back person that likes watching movies and chilling with my cat, Theodore. Hopefully you learn something new while you're here, and thanks for visiting!</p>

    <p id="mahsa" class="beef boi">Hi, my name is Mahsa. I am in my fifth year of honours Life Sciences at McMaster University. I've always been passionate about research and science communication. My research focus involves finding the mechanism underlying Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). I am a firm believer that science thrives through communication. Effective science communication builds support for science, promotes understanding of its wider relevance to society, and encourages more informed decision-making at all levels. As Tellura's Head of Youth Journal, I want to help with making science literature more accessible for younger students.</p>

Tellura is an amazing opportunity for students of grades 7-12 to submit their work and gain experience in scientific research. I am excited to share this opportunity with the community!</p>
