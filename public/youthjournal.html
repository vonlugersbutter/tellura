        <h2>our journal</h2>
        <p>Tellura publishes a monthly journal of works written by students from grades 7 to 12, and edited by undergraduate students. Undergraduate students work closely with the writers to ensure that their work is clear, accurate, and applies the concepts that are discussed in our guides and blog posts. This is an opportunity for younger students to learn about science writing from mentors, and have their work publicized.</p>
